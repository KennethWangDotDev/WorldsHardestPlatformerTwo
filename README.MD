## Introduction

My primary goal with World’s Hardest Platformer 2 is to create a skill-based 2D platformer game that builds on the idea of challenge in a way that is not unfair or frustrating, but fun. The things that will make my game stand out are the challenge of the game, the plethora of platforming features/mechanics, the cross-compatibility features, the level editor, and  the multiplayer mode.

The intended audience will be primarily hardcore gamers who have played other skill-based platformers and enjoy these types of games. However, casual gamers should also be able to complete and enjoy the game. This is achieved by adding many “secrets” that unlock harder levels, whereas the linear story levels are much easier.
